# random_friends_quiz
An unknown number of friends go to the restaurant together. They eat and drink exactly the same amount. 
Finally, the bill arrives. The total amount is written on the bill. 
Every person has random amounts of money. Each one pays this random amount of money until the total is satisfied. 
The app should calculate how much money each person paid too much or too little with respect to the average amount.
